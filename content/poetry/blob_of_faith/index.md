The daily divinations of this earthly life. \
To behold and wonder, the quotidian penance. \
Strewn across the cosmic lake.\
Instantiations in time and space. \
Light lamps of words! \
Let the flames seep through the water and sand. \
Offer tunes of adorations!\
Let the sounds float on the rhythm of waves. \
To process that which eternally is. \
To see it thrive in all that there is. \
The murmuring mysteries of mundane sight. \
In the dances of the day and talking night. \
The mind that ponders and the heart that believes. \
Limbs that swim in perennial waters. \
A daily witness to the cosmic hum. \
Here I stand as a blob of faith...

— Ayalavan
