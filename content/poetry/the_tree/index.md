"I like trees, you know..."<br>
"Good for you"<br>
Crooked branches tickling the skies<br>
Balancing between nonchalance and grace.<br>
"How old are you?"<br>
"Much older than what you people have built; much younger than what it is built on"<br>
Clothed in colours<br>
a dress that deceives.<br>
"You must have been here for a long time"<br>
"Comparatively"<br>
Time is relative<br>
what can we say<br>
"What do you think about the changes around you?"<br>
"I don't"<br>
"Something must have occurred"<br>
"Not really! I am a tree. I don't do that"<br>
"You say you are amidst all of this, yet unbothered"<br>
"Yes! I live until I can and perish when I can't"<br>
A mutual friend of life and death;<br>
a journey in its own ways.<br>
"I am different. An end awaits and I know it. Yet, I dance and scream trying to peak beyond"<br>
"I have seen"<br>
The breeze swept<br>
merging us with the skies.<br>
Some silence that left us quiet.<br>
"You know tree, I aspire to become like you someday"<br>
"You stupid human beings! You people will never change..."<br>
