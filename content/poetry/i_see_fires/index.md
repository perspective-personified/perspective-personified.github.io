I see fires.<br>
I see flames all around.<br>
In the flimsy glow of the street lamps,<br>
In the table dances of the candle light,<br>
In the blunt end of dark shadows,<br>
In the colourful scribbles of a neighbour,<br>
In the delightful smile and the gentle tears,<br>
Hanging from the roof I sleep under,<br>
Seeping above the earth I wander, <br>
I feel the warmth that sustains and the light that slashes and kills. <br>
I see the endless dances of an eternal chasm that reminds me that I too shall one day perish. <br>
That I will be embraced by those prisms once and forever. <br>
And I shall become that and that alone...<br>

â€” Ayalavan
