Poetry?\
Word that sounds\
And word that reads\
Friend and foe\
In the journey that leads\
Sonic and syllable\
The pupil and the lid\
To see\
With more than the eye\
Blinking intervals\
Of stops and silence\
The movement of sound\
The movement of meaning\
Ruptures, hidden pauses\
In seeming concurrence\
And transgressive isolation.\
Towards the pounding heart\
And the churning soul.\
What do you see?

— Ayalavan
