Recently, I had the chance to look at the  inner chamber of the vimana at the Gangaikonda Cholpauram temple. An experience that felt like taking a privileged peek into the subconscious of a monument that is considered a pinnacle of South Indian temple architecture. Above the garbha griha in the temple, there is a vast empty chamber in the vimana. The roof of this chamber, built with brick and limestone plaster, constitutes the inner wall of the vimana. This roof is built by tapering and layering several brick rows on top of another (to form a pyramidal concentric of several shapes), that convene below the globular shikara on the top. The entire chamber can be seen from the top tier of the vimana. 

The sight of the inner chamber was a testimony to the enormity of human creativity. It was evidence that notorious minds, audacious enough to imagine the possibility of building such a structure, roamed this land centuries ago! Their society nurtured these minds, believed in its vision and undertook a glorious collaboration that culminated in the construction of one of the most monumental structures in the history of humankind.

The inner chamber (the portion of the temple that I consider to be the closest to the idea of the temple), was equally a peek into the minds of a society that thrived on this planet ages ago. Even more so, it was a peek into the dreams of that society! Nearly a thousand year old dreams were laid out in front of me in naked grandiosity! There was freakish nostalgia in beholding that sight. I come back to write this, not to narrate the experience, but to produce a testimony of my own to the magic of merely witnessing that sight. I write this to sow my dream in the fertile emptiness of the chamber! 

Oftentimes, we get confused between a vimana and a gopura. The latter is an arch or tower that is built in the entrances of temples, while the former is a super-structure built on top of the garbha griha (sanctum). The word vimana denotes something that can fly, or something that leaves the earth (ground). We are all familiar with Ravana’s Pushpaka vimana from the Ramayana. Likewise, the portion of the temple that attempts to leave the ground (rather, plummet from the ground) is the vimana. While the other parts of a temple (mantapa, prakara, etc) are built to fall towards the ground, it is the vimana that attempts flight. There is literally and symbolically an elevation that is implicit in the structure of the vimana. 

According to the agama(s), the vimana of the Gangaikonda Cholapuram temple is classified as a “sandhara” vimana. The word “sandhara” refers to the pradhakshina pada (circumambulatory  path) built in between the inner and the outer walls of the vimana. So, the vimanas with the provisional gap between the inner and outer walls for the construction of a circumambulatory path is classified as a sandhara vimana. The vimanas with outer and inner walls built adjacent to each other (without the gap) are classified as “asandhara” vimanas. Some of the earliest sandhara vimanas can be seen in the Kanchi Kailasanatha temple and the Vijayalaya Choleshwaram temple complex (in Narthamalai, Pudukottai). 

A more recent and popular sandhara vimana that we know of is from the Periya Kovil in Thanjavur, commissioned to construction by Rajaraja Chola 1 (the father of Rajendra Chola 1, who commissioned the construction of the Gangaikonda Cholapuram temple). The sandhara in Thanjavur Kovil is two-storeyed. The second storey houses the sculptures of the 108 karana(s) in bharathanatyam (listed in bharathamuni’s natyasastra). (The karana sculpture series in the second tier of the Thanjavur Periya Kovil sandhara is unfinished. Only 83 sculptures are complete).

The temple plan (and the layout of the vimana in particular) of the Gangaikonda Cholapuram temple is heavily inspired by the Thanjavur Periya Kovil. It is often described as its feminine counterpart. Both the vimanas are stylistically very similar. The garbha grigha is enclosed by a two-storeyed sandhara. Originally, the garbha grihas (housing the Shiva lingas) and the entire inner portion of the vimanas in both these temples were undisrupted and completely hollow. Later, roofs were built on top of the Shiva Lingas in order to prevent bird and bat excreta from falling on the deity. The inner and outer walls of the vimana meet on top of the sandhara (forming a beautiful cascading pattern on the roof) and rise adjacently towards the bulbous shikara on the top. The super-structure above the sandhara is 13-storeyed in Thanjavur and 9-storeyed in Gangaikonda Cholapuram. Popular lore has it that Rajendra Chola wanted to build a vimana taller than what his father had built in Thanjavur, but failed due to the lack of cooperation from the temple’s foundation. So he had to cap the structure after the 9th tier. Some even claim that there is an observable tilt in the 9th tier, supposedly caused by the erosion of soil in the foundation due to excessive weight. All these claims are heavily contested and lack solid historical evidence. 

Though it is evident that Gangaikonda Cholapuram borrows many of its elementary features from the Thanjavur Periya Kovil, it has a profoundly original architectural idea that easily transcends its contemporary influences. Far from being a modified reconstruction of its influences, Gangaikonda Cholapuram presents a novel architectural idea and challenges itself to preserve it for posterity. 

If Thanjavur Periya Kovil’s originality is its attempt towards magnificence, Gangaikonda Cholapuram is profoundly original in its attempt towards concealment. In other words, the novel idea of the monument seems to manifest in what the structure does not show (and for that matter, cannot show) to its beholder. This manifest concealment does not seem like an attempt to hide, disguise or create illusions of appearances. Rather, this concealment seems to be an attempt to capture (or to realise) that which we can never see; that which is forever concealed.

The monument seems to gain its profoundly unique architectural personality in repeatedly indicating this concealment in multiple instances and layers. There is a recurring attempt to scale towards that which is forever concealed. I wish to draw a parallel to some musical ideas that capture silence as their central quality. Similarly, the monument repeatedly tries to show what one can never see. In both these cases, there is a striving to hear what one can never hear and see what one can never see. Hearing and vision are utilised to realise the presence of something that is beyond its confines. Its sight, or rather its beholding, is presented to us through its concealment. This, I find to be a defining tendency in the idea behind the Gangaikonda Cholapuram temple. What I saw in the inner chamber of the temple’s vimana, is a raw, crude and daringly naked exposition of it. 

In the case of Thanjavur Periya Kovil, the outer wall rises to the shikara as tapering squares, forming the pyramidal structure. The inner wall (seen from the similar inner chamber in the Thanjavur Kovil vimana) begins to ascend as tapering squares, but gradually turns into circles as it progresses towards the shikara. These massive inner and outer walls are erected separately from the foundation and are merged together on top of the sandhara in the second storey. This merging is done by building cascading rows from both the walls (a brilliant technique for weight balance) that adjoin at some point and rise together as a single wall. The sheer size and massiveness of this structure makes us realize the magnificence of the idea behind the Thanjavur Periya Kovil. 

However, at Gangaikonda Cholapuram things are curiously different! The structure of the vimana is perhaps one of the greatest play with architectural forms. The outer wall of the vimana has a portion on all four sides that is seen projected (protruding) from the original structure. This disrupts the notion of a pyramidal vimana very explicitly. This structural projection is called a badhra sala in the agama(s). Though the badhra sala cannot be built without reference to the original pyramidal structure, its construction defies the very notion of a pyramid (by giving the vimana a whole new appearance). 

The inner wall begins to ascend as tapering squares. Gradually, the squares turn into hexagons and then octagons and then finally become circles as they rise towards the shikara. All the shapes are constructed in reference to the circular foundation of the Shiva Linga in the garba griha. Therefore, it wouldn't be wrong to say that the inner wall begins its journey towards the shikara as a circle. That is, the inner wall shows us a gradual progression of a circle, to a square, to a hexagon, to an octagon and finally, a circle again. This sequence conceals all these polygons in a circle by making them arise from and dissolve into one, indicating the origination and evanescence of shapes in a circle.

Looking at this, I was reminded of an essay by Isaac Asimov (introduced to me by a teacher) on extra-terrestrial life. The essay raises one very fundamental question– how can we know if there is life on a planet that has been newly discovered? To this, one of the many answers Asimov provides is to spot the shapes on the surface of the planet. He says that if there are any other recognizable shapes apart from circles, we can be certain that there is life on that planet. This is because the circle is the only naturally occurring shape. Any other shape is a product of intelligence. 

It felt almost revelatory to observe that the inner wall of the Gangaikonda Cholapuram temple was demonstrating a progression of shapes from and to the only naturally occurring shape. Within the bandwidth of a naturally occurring circle, the temple conceals several shapes (the products of intelligence). From nature originated intelligence, and towards nature progressed intelligence, eventually merging with it. This progression shows a picture that cannot be seen but can be realised through the concealment in the form. This is perhaps the most raw and expositorily naked indication to that concealment in the temple. The vimana has achieved its elevation in sophisticatedly submitting to its innate limitations. 

In the middle of the inner chamber, above the roof of the garba griha, there was a glass peephole to look at the Shiva Linga. I peeped into it to find myself standing on top of one of the largest Shiva Lingas in the world. A moment of intense elevation, only to look up and find myself standing below the grand confluence of shapes into the ultimate circle. There I stood, another dreamer in that eternal progression!
